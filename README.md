Quest VR Menu

The app right now puts you on a plane with some cubes and text. The text is for debugging, the blue cube is for launching apps, and the small cubes are "GameCubes" that have a name on them refering to the app they should launch when they collide with the blue Console cube.

Right now its random what apps gets tied to the cubes.
